## 📌 Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of **150 logic problems** solved using **Dart**. The project is structured into three progressive levels, starting from basic programming foundations to advanced algorithmic challenges. Each solution is focused on **Clean Code**, **Performance**, and **Logical Efficiency**.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository is divided into three main packages to ensure a smooth learning curve:

| Folder | Level | Difficulty | Focus Area | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Level 1**](./level1) | Beginner | Easy | Basic Math, Input/Output, Simple Conditions | ✅ Done |
| [**Level 2**](./level2) | Intermediate | Medium | Loops, Patterns, String Manipulation, Enums | 🔄 In Progress |
| [**Level 3**](./level3) | Advanced | Hard | Complex Logic, Matrix Operations, Optimization | ⏳ Planned |

## 📝 Level 2: Highlights (Current Progress)
Below is a categorized index of solved problems in Level 2. I use **Commit Messages** and **Doc-Comments** to explain the logic behind each solution.

| # | Problem Title | Description | Solution Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| 01 | Multiplication Table | Generates tables from 1 to 10 | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_001.dart) |
| 10 | Reverse Digits | Algorithm to reverse and print number digits | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_010.dart) |
| 11 | Palindrome Check | Validating numbers that read same backwards | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_011.dart) |
| 14 | Inverted Patterns | Advanced nested loops for letter patterns | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_014.dart) |
| 16 | String Permutations | Generating all combinations from AAA to ZZZ | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_016.dart) |
| 17 | Password Guesser | Brute-force logic for password matching | [View Code](./level2/bin/problem_017.dart) |

## 🛠 Features of My Code
* **Structured Libraries:** Shared functions are kept in `lib/` to follow the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
* **Informative Commits:** Every problem has a descriptive commit message explaining the logic.
* **Flutter Ready:** These logic skills are the backbone of my high-performance Flutter applications.
